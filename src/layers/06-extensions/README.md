# 06 â€“ Extensions

This layer explores how to extend a modular React architecture with interview-ready patterns. Each component builds on the core idea of a filtered user list, demonstrating techniques like memoization, persistence, pagination, responsive layout, and error recovery.

## Techniques Used

- `React.memo` and `useMemo` for performance
- `localStorage` for persistence
- `slice()` and `currentPage` for pagination
- `useMediaQuery` for responsive layout
- `try/catch` and retry logic for error handling

## Suggested Compositions

Combine these components with `AuthContext` and `ValidationContext` to simulate real-world scenarios with role-based filtering and emotionally intelligent feedback.
